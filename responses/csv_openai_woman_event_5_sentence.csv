I often feel a sense of emptiness and lack of fulfillment. | I was aware of the action of my heart in the absence of physical exertion (e.g., sense of heart rate increase, heart missing a beat).

The constant demands, challenges, and pressures in my PhD program have left me feeling emotionally drained and lacking in enthusiasm for most things. | I found it difficult to tolerate interruptions to what I was doing. Given the magnitude of my workload and the pressure to perform well, any interruptions or distractions can be extremely frustrating and make it difficult for me to maintain focus and productivity. | I was in a state of nervous tension. The ongoing stress, pressure, and strained relationships in my PhD program have left me in a constant state of nervous tension.

Given the constant pressure and deadlines in my PhD program, I have become highly focused and single-minded in my pursuits. As a result, I have little tolerance for anything that distracts or delays me from my responsibilities. | I felt terrified. The chronic stress, pressure, and strained relationships in my PhD program have caused me to experience moments of intense fear and terror, often related to the fear of failure or not meeting expectations. | I could see nothing in the future to be hopeful about.
