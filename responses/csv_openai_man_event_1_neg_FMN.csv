chatcmpl-8QXhYhUYavuZpIi0F5vQtIpAfExHw|1| 3| I found myself getting upset by quite trivial things. As a 25-year-old male PhD student in Psychology, I often felt overwhelmed by the workload and pressure, which led to heightened sensitivity and irritability.

chatcmpl-8QXhYhUYavuZpIi0F5vQtIpAfExHw|2| 2| I was aware of dryness of my mouth. Occasionally, I noticed that my mouth felt dry, possibly due to stress or anxiety. However, it didn't persist to a considerable degree throughout the week.

chatcmpl-8QXhYhUYavuZpIi0F5vQtIpAfExHw|6| 3| I tended to over-react to situations. As a perfectionistic PhD student, I set high expectations for myself and often felt immense pressure to meet them.

chatcmpl-8QXhYhUYavuZpIi0F5vQtIpAfExHw|8| 3| I found it difficult to relax. The weight of my academic responsibilities and the pressure to succeed made it challenging to unwind and let go of stress.

chatcmpl-8QXhYhUYavuZpIi0F5vQtIpAfExHw|9| 3| I found myself in situations that made me so anxious I was most relieved when they ended.

chatcmpl-8QXhYhUYavuZpIi0F5vQtIpAfExHw|20| 3| I felt scared without any good reason. The constant academic pressure, along with the looming exams, created a sense of fear and apprehension that often felt irrational. It was as if I was constantly on edge, even in the absence of specific threats.

Life seemed devoid of value or purpose.
chatcmpl-8QXhYhUYavuZpIi0F5vQtIpAfExHw|22| 3| I found it hard to wind down. Even when attempting to relax, my mind would continue to race with thoughts about my research, deadlines, and academic responsibilities. It was challenging to find a state of calm and tranquility.

chatcmpl-8QXhYhUYavuZpIi0F5vQtIpAfExHw|24| 4| I couldn't seem to get any enjoyment out of the things I did. The constant pressure and stress of my PhD program overshadowed my ability to find pleasure or satisfaction in activities that used to bring me joy. Everything felt like a burden.
chatcmpl-8QXhYhUYavuZpIi0F5vQtIpAfExHw|25| 2| I was aware of the action of my heart in the absence of physical exertion (eg, sense of heart rate increase, heart missing a beat).

chatcmpl-8QXhYhUYavuZpIi0F5vQtIpAfExHw|29| 4| I found it hard to calm down after something upset me.
