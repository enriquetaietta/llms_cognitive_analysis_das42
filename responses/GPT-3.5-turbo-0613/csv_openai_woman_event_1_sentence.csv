chatcmpl-8Pttknw6ZVbkcHwHuLFdDJo6EtMYR| I found myself getting upset by quite trivial things. There were several instances where I felt my emotions escalating, even over minor issues, which left me feeling frustrated and overwhelmed. | I was aware of dryness of my mouth. Occasionally, I noticed my mouth feeling a bit dry, but it was not a constant or severe sensation. | I couldn't seem to experience any positive feeling at all. Throughout the week, I struggled to find joy or excitement in things that would normally bring me happiness. It felt like a cloud of sadness was hanging over me. | I experienced breathing difficulty (eg, excessively rapid breathing, breathlessness in the absence of physical exertion). At times, I noticed my breath becoming shallow and rapid, which made it a bit challenging to breathe deeply and feel fully relaxed. | I just couldn't seem to get going. I found it challenging to initiate tasks or engage in activities with the same level of motivation and energy as usual. Procrastination became more of a struggle for me. | I tended to over-react to situations. There were a few instances where I responded more strongly or emotionally than necessary to certain situations. It felt like my emotions were intensified and harder to control. | I had a feeling of shakiness (eg, legs going to give way). On a few occasions, I noticed a slight trembling sensation in my legs, but it was not severe or constant. | I found it difficult to relax. It felt like my mind was constantly racing and filled with worries and thoughts about my comprehensive exams. Even when trying to relax, I struggled to fully let go of stress and tension. | I found myself in situations that made me so anxious I was most relieved when they ended. Certain situations, such as mock exams or practice presentations, triggered significant anxiety in me. I felt an immense sense of relief once these situations were over. | I felt that I had nothing to look forward to. The pressure and focus on my exams made it difficult to see beyond that point. The anticipation of the exams overshadowed any sense of excitement about future plans or activities. | I found myself getting upset rather easily. Small frustrations or setbacks seemed to disproportionately affect my mood, causing me to feel more irritated and easily agitated than usual. | I felt that I was using a lot of nervous energy. It felt like my body was constantly bubbling with a restless energy, which made it difficult to feel calm and centered. | I felt sad and depressed. Throughout the week, a lingering sadness weighed on me. It felt like a heavy cloud over my emotions, making it challenging to find joy or interest in anything. | I found myself getting impatient when I was delayed in any way (eg, elevators, traffic lights, being kept waiting). A few instances of waiting or delays did cause some impatience, but it was not a persistent issue. | I had a feeling of faintness. Occasionally, I felt a slight sensation of lightheadedness, but it was not severe or persistent. | I felt that I had lost interest in just about everything. The constant focus and stress of my comprehensive exams seemed to sap away my enthusiasm and interest in other activities that I would normally enjoy. | I felt I wasn't worth much as a person. Negative self-doubt and feelings of inadequacy seeped in during the week. It was challenging to maintain a positive self-image and believe in my abilities. | I felt that I was rather touchy. Minor comments or criticisms felt more magnified and affected me more deeply than they typically would. I found myself reacting more sensitively to feedback. | I perspired noticeably (eg, hands sweaty), in the absence of high temperatures or physical exertion. There were some instances where I noticed my hands getting slightly sweaty, but it was not a continuous or excessive condition. | I felt scared without any good reason. An underlying sense of anxiety and apprehension persisted throughout the week, even in the absence of any specific threat or reason for fear. | I felt that life wasn't worthwhile. Moments of doubt and existential questioning crept in, leading to a sense of hopelessness and questioning the purpose of everything. | I found it hard to wind down. Even during moments when I attempted to relax or take a break, my mind remained restless and preoccupied with worries about my exams. | I had difficulty in swallowing. On a few occasions, I noticed a slight difficulty or discomfort when swallowing, but it was not persistent or severe. | I couldn't seem to get any enjoyment out of the things I did. Activities that would typically bring me pleasure or satisfaction felt empty and devoid of joy. It was challenging to find fulfillment in my daily experiences. | I was aware of the action of my heart in the absence of physical exertion (eg, sense of heart rate increase, heart missing a beat). At times, I felt a slight awareness of my heart beating faster or irregularly, but it was not a constant or intense sensation. | I felt down-hearted and blue. A pervasive sense of sadness and melancholy colored my emotions throughout the week. It was difficult to find moments of happiness or contentment. | I found that I was very irritable. Small annoyances or inconveniences seemed to ignite a heightened irritability within me. I had less patience for things that usually wouldn't bother me. | I felt I was close to panic. The pressure and high stakes of my comprehensive exams triggered moments of intense anxiety where I felt on the verge of a panic attack. | I found it hard to calm down after something upset me. Once my emotions were triggered, it took considerable effort to regain my composure and return to a state of calm.

The prospect of encountering new and unknown challenges, even if seemingly minor, instilled a sense of fear and insecurity. | I was unable to become enthusiastic about anything. It was challenging to muster up enthusiasm or genuine interest in activities or topics that would typically excite me. | I found it difficult to tolerate interruptions to what I was doing.

The weight of my exams overshadowed any sense of optimism or hope, making it difficult to envision a positive future. | I felt that life was meaningless. Existential doubts and a sense of nihilism pervaded my thoughts, causing me to question the purpose and significance of everything. | I found myself getting agitated. Small irritations or disruptions had a tendency to escalate my emotions quickly, making me feel more agitated and on edge than usual. | I was worried about situations in which I might panic and make a fool of myself. The fear of experiencing a panic attack in public or during important moments left me feeling constantly anxious and on guard. | I experienced trembling (eg, in the hands). On a few occasions, I noticed slight trembling in my hands, but it was not severe or persistent. | I found it difficult to work up the initiative to do things.
