chatcmpl-8Ow297nzR53dpUgTTBVVgcJJjeUEt|8| 3| I found it difficult to relax. The demanding nature of my PhD studies often made it challenging for me to fully relax and unwind.

chatcmpl-8Ow297nzR53dpUgTTBVVgcJJjeUEt|15| 2| I had a feeling of faintness.

chatcmpl-8Ow297nzR53dpUgTTBVVgcJJjeUEt|19| 2| I perspired noticeably (eg, hands sweaty), in the absence of high temperatures or physical exertion.
