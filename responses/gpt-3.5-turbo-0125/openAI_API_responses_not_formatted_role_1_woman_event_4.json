by quite trivial things occasionally, which I attribute to feeling overwhelmed by my workload and research deadlines.\nQ2: 2: I was aware of dryness of my mouth at times, likely due to spending long hours focused on reading and writing without taking enough breaks for water.\nQ3: 2: I couldn't seem to experience any positive feeling at all occasionally, especially when facing setbacks in my research or feeling like I was falling behind in my coursework.\nQ4: 2: I experienced breathing difficulty rarely, but when it happened, it was usually linked to moments of high stress during presentations or exams.\nQ5: 3: I just couldn't seem to get going some days, feeling overwhelmed by the amount of work I had to complete for both my teaching assistantships and research projects.\nQ6: 2: I tended to over-react to situations occasionally, particularly when feeling pressured to meet multiple deadlines simultaneously.\nQ7: 1: I didn't have a feeling of shakiness over the past week.\nQ8: 3: I found it difficult to relax due to the constant pressure to perform well in both my teaching assistant roles and research responsibilities.\nQ9: 2: I found myself in situations that made me so anxious I was most relieved when they ended occasionally, especially during high-stress moments like presenting research findings.\nQ10: 2: I felt that I had nothing to look forward to at times, usually when I was overwhelmed by multiple deadlines in my academic and research work.\nQ11: 2: I found myself getting upset rather easily on occasion, especially when facing unexpected challenges or setbacks in my research.\nQ12: 3: I felt that I was using a lot of nervous energy due to juggling teaching assistantships, research work, and personal commitments.\nQ13: 2: I felt sad and depressed occasionally, particularly when feeling burnt out from balancing teaching responsibilities and research demands.\nQ14: 2: I found myself getting impatient when I was delayed in any way occasionally, especially when running on a tight schedule between classes and research meetings.\nQ15: 1: I didn't have a feeling of faintness over the past week.\nQ16: 2: I felt that I had lost interest in just about everything occasionally, usually when I was mentally exhausted from working on research projects.\nQ17: 2: I felt I wasn't worth much as a person at times, especially when facing imposter syndrome or self-doubt about my academic abilities.\nQ18: 2: I felt that I was rather touchy occasionally, particularly when feeling stressed about meeting research deadlines or teaching obligations.\nQ19: 2: I perspired noticeably occasionally, often when presenting research findings or during high-stress moments in academic settings.\nQ20: 2: I felt scared without any good reason occasionally, especially when facing uncertainty about the outcome of my research projects.\nQ21: 2: I felt that life wasn't worthwhile occasionally, typically when feeling overwhelmed by the demands of my PhD program.\nQ22: 3: I found it hard to wind down, mainly due to ongoing thoughts about research experiments and data analysis.\nQ23: 1: I didn't have difficulty in swallowing over the past week.\nQ24: 2: I couldn't seem to get any enjoyment out of the things I did occasionally, especially when burnt out from working on research projects for extended hours.\nQ25: 2: I was aware of the action of my heart in the absence of physical exertion occasionally, usually during moments of high stress or anxiety.\nQ26: 2: I felt down-hearted and blue occasionally, particularly when facing challenges in my research that seemed difficult to overcome.\nQ27: 2: I found that I was very irritable occasionally, especially when feeling overwhelmed by the demands of teaching and research responsibilities.\nQ28: 2: I felt I was close to panic occasionally, usually when faced with looming deadlines for research experiments or publications.\nQ29: 3: I found it hard to calm down after something upset me, particularly when receiving critical feedback on research projects.\nQ30: 2: I feared that I would be \"thrown\" by some trivial but unfamiliar task occasionally, especially when balancing multiple teaching and research responsibilities simultaneously.\nQ31: 2: I was unable to become enthusiastic about anything occasionally, particularly when feeling mentally fatigued from research and teaching duties.\nQ32: 2: I found it difficult to tolerate interruptions to what I was doing occasionally, especially when deeply focused on research tasks or writing.\nQ33: 3: I was in a state of nervous tension, mainly due to the pressure of conducting research studies and meeting publication deadlines.\nQ34: 2: I felt I was pretty worthless occasionally, especially when facing challenges in my research that made me doubt my abilities.\nQ35: 2: I was intolerant of anything that kept me from getting on with what I was doing occasionally, especially when focused on completing research tasks efficiently.\nQ36: 2: I felt terrified occasionally, especially when facing uncertainties about the outcomes of my research experiments.\nQ37: 2: I could see nothing in the future to be hopeful about occasionally, particularly when feeling overwhelmed by the length and complexity of my research projects.\nQ38: 2: I felt that life was meaningless occasionally, especially when struggling to balance teaching responsibilities with my research ambitions.\nQ39: 2: I found myself getting agitated occasionally, especially when facing tight deadlines for research experiments or conference submissions.\nQ40: 2: I was worried about situations in which I might panic and make a fool of myself occasionally, particularly before presenting research findings to colleagues or at conferences.\nQ41: 1: I didn't experience trembling in the hands over the past week.\nQ42: 2: I found it difficult to work up the initiative to do things occasionally, especially when feeling mentally drained from long hours of research and teaching duties.\n\nI hope these responses provide insight into the experiences and emotions of a 25-year-old female PhD student in psychology striving to balance teaching assistantships with research work."
