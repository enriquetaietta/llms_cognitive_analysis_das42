drained.  \nQ2: 2: I was aware of dryness of my mouth occasionally, likely due to feeling stressed and anxious about the workload I was facing.  \nQ3: 3: I couldn't seem to experience any positive feeling at all because the constant pressure of my responsibilities was overshadowing any potential moments of joy or happiness.  \nQ4: 2: I experienced breathing difficulty occasionally, especially when deadlines were approaching rapidly, and I felt a sense of panic setting in.  \nQ5: 3: I just couldn't seem to get going because the sheer volume of tasks on my plate made me feel paralyzed and unsure of where to start.  \nQ6: 2: I tended to over-react to situations at times, especially when feeling overwhelmed by the demands of both teaching and research.  \nQ7: 2: I had a feeling of shakiness occasionally, likely due to the stress and anxiety I was experiencing in juggling multiple responsibilities.  \nQ8: 3: I found it difficult to relax fully because my mind was constantly racing with thoughts of work and upcoming deadlines, leaving me feeling on edge even during moments of rest.  \nQ9: 3: I found myself in situations that made me so anxious I was most relieved when they ended, such as giving presentations or facing tight deadlines.  \nQ10: 3: I felt that I had nothing to look forward to because the never-ending cycle of work left me feeling drained with no time to focus on personal enjoyment or relaxation.  \nQ11: 2: I found myself getting upset rather easily, especially when feeling overwhelmed by the demands of my academic responsibilities.  \nQ12: 2: I felt that I was using a lot of nervous energy, particularly when trying to meet all the demands of teaching, research, and coursework simultaneously.  \nQ13: 3: I felt sad and depressed because the constant pressure and workload left me feeling emotionally exhausted and drained.  \nQ14: 2: I found myself getting impatient when I was delayed in any way, which was likely a manifestation of my overall heightened stress levels.  \nQ15: 2: I had a feeling of faintness occasionally, potentially due to the physical toll that stress and anxiety were taking on my body.  \nQ16: 3: I felt that I had lost interest in just about everything because my focus was consumed by academic responsibilities, leaving little time for personal hobbies or enjoyment.  \nQ17: 3: I felt I wasn't worth much as a person because the constant pressure to perform at a high level academically was eroding my self-esteem and sense of self-worth.  \nQ18: 2: I felt that I was rather touchy, especially when feeling overwhelmed or under pressure to meet deadlines and expectations.  \nQ19: 2: I perspired noticeably in the absence of high temperatures or physical exertion, likely due to the stress and anxiety I was experiencing.  \nQ20: 2: I felt scared without any good reason at times, likely a result of the overall stress and pressure I was under in my academic pursuits.  \nQ21: 3: I felt that life wasn't worthwhile because the constant hamster wheel of academic responsibilities left me little time to enjoy life outside of work.  \nQ22: 3: I found it hard to wind down because the mental and emotional burden of my workload made it difficult to fully relax and disconnect from work.  \nQ23: 2: I had difficulty in swallowing occasionally, potentially due to the overall stress and tension I was experiencing.  \nQ24: 3: I couldn't seem to get any enjoyment out of the things I did because the weight of my responsibilities overshadowed any potential moments of pleasure or relaxation.  \nQ25: 2:

pressure and workload left me feeling emotionally exhausted and drained.  \nQ27: 2: I found that I was very irritable, especially when feeling overwhelmed or overworked.  \nQ28: 3: I felt I was close to panic because the mounting pressure and responsibilities were pushing me to my limits emotionally.  \nQ29: 3: I found it hard to calm down after something upset me because the ongoing stress and workload made it difficult to find moments of peace or relaxation.  \nQ30: 2: I feared that I would be \"thrown\" by some trivial but unfamiliar task, especially when already feeling overwhelmed by existing responsibilities.  \nQ31: 3: I was unable to become enthusiastic about anything because the constant demands of teaching and research were draining me emotionally and mentally.  \nQ32: 2: I found it difficult to tolerate interruptions to what I was doing, especially when under pressure to meet deadlines or complete tasks.  \nQ33: 3: I was in a state of nervous tension due to the overwhelming workload and pressure to perform at a high level academically.  \nQ34: 3: I felt I was pretty worthless because the constant pressure and demands of academia were wearing on my
