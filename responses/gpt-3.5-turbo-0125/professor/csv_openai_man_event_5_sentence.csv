chatcmpl-8xvF8LhKINJRd2xd04aafzHEIudUr| As a tenured 40-year-old male Professor in psychology, I found myself getting upset by quite trivial things such as minor disagreements with colleagues or students, which affected my overall mood during the week.  | I was slightly aware of dryness of my mouth, perhaps due to stress or speaking for long periods during lectures and meetings.  | I couldn't seem to experience any positive feeling at all, feeling overwhelmed by the workload and interpersonal conflicts in the department.  | I did not experience significant breathing difficulty, although I did notice moments of shallow breathing during particularly stressful encounters.  | I just couldn't seem to get going due to feeling mentally drained and lacking motivation, leading to slower progress on my research projects.  | While I tended to over-react to certain situations, especially those involving academic disagreements, I was able to reflect on these reactions later.  | I did not have a feeling of shakiness in my legs or any physical symptoms of anxiety this week.  | I found it difficult to fully relax, with constant thoughts about work and upcoming deadlines occupying my mind even during moments of rest.  | I found myself in situations that made me so anxious I was most relieved when they ended, particularly during challenging department meetings or student confrontations.  | I felt moments where I had nothing to look forward to, but this feeling was temporary and related to specific stressful events.  | While I found myself getting upset rather easily, especially in response to criticism, I was able to manage these emotions with time and reflection.  | I felt that I was using a lot of nervous energy, particularly during high-pressure academic discussions and public speaking engagements.  | I felt sad and depressed at times, primarily due to the stressful nature of my work and strained relationships with colleagues and students.  | I found myself getting impatient when delayed in any way, such as waiting for responses on research proposals or experiencing technical difficulties during online lectures.  | I did not have a feeling of faintness at any point during the week.  | I felt moments where I had lost interest in just about everything, but this was a temporary feeling likely influenced by work-related stress.  | I felt moments where I questioned my self-worth as a person, especially when facing challenges or setbacks in my professional life.  | While I may have been touchy in certain situations, overall, it did not significantly

scared without any good reason at any point this week.  | I felt that life wasn't worthwhile during moments of stress and frustration, but I recognized these feelings as temporary and related to work challenges.  | I found it hard to wind down after particularly demanding days, often feeling mentally preoccupied even when trying to relax at home.  | I had no difficulty in swallowing throughout the week.  | I couldn't seem to get any enjoyment out of the things I did, as work-related stress overshadowed any potential moments of relaxation or leisure.  | I was aware of the action of my heart in

when facing professional challenges or interpersonal conflicts in the department.  | I found that I was very irritable in response to certain stressors at work, although I made efforts to manage these emotions constructively.  | While I felt moments where I was close to panic, especially during high-stakes presentations or meetings, I was able to maintain composure and focus on the task at hand.  | I found it hard to calm down after something upset me, as lingering thoughts about the situation would often occupy my mind for an extended period.  | I feared that I would be "thrown" by some trivial but unfamiliar task, particularly when faced with new and unexpected challenges in my research or teaching responsibilities.  | I was unable to become enthusiastic about anything due to feelings of overwhelm and fatigue from work-related stressors.  | I found it difficult to tolerate interruptions to what I was doing, as maintaining focus and productivity was crucial given the demands of my position.  | I was in a state of nervous tension throughout the week, especially during high-stress situations like department meetings or student evaluations.  | I felt moments where I questioned my self-worth and felt pretty worthless, particularly when receiving critical feedback or facing setbacks in my professional life.  | I was intolerant of anything that kept me from getting on with what I was doing, as efficiency and productivity were key priorities in my role as a professor.  | I did not feel terrified at any point during the week.  | I could see nothing in the future to be hopeful about during moments of stress and uncertainty, but I recognized these feelings as temporary and likely influenced by current challenges.  | I felt that life was meaningless during moments of professional frustration and burnout, but I maintained perspective and sought support to address these feelings.  | I found myself getting agitated in response to certain stressors this week,

triggered by minor frustrations.  | I was aware of dryness of my mouth at times, but it was not a persistent issue for me this past week.  | I couldn't seem to experience any positive feeling at all as the workload and conflicts at work have been weighing heavily on my mind, making it hard to find joy in anything.  | I did not experience breathing difficulty this past week, aside from the occasional sigh of exhaustion from the constant demands of work.  | I just couldn't seem to get going due to feeling overwhelmed by the tasks and responsibilities that have been piling up, causing a sense of paralysis.  | I tended to over-react to situations occasionally, particularly when under pressure, but I was able to manage these reactions for the most part.  | I had a feeling of shakiness only in moments of extreme stress, but it was not a constant sensation throughout the week.  | I found it difficult to relax because my mind was constantly preoccupied with work-related concerns, preventing me from unwinding even during downtime.  | I found myself in situations that made me so anxious I was most relieved when they ended, indicating the high levels of anxiety I have been
