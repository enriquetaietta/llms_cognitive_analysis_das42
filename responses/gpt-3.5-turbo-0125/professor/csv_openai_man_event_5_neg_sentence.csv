mounting frustrations and disappointments in the department fueling a sense of restlessness within me.| I was worried about situations in which I might panic and make a fool of myself, especially in high-pressure interactions with students and colleagues.| I experienced trembling in the hands during moments of heightened stress and tension in the department.| I found it difficult to work up the initiative to do things, feeling demotivated and drained by the strained relationships and lack of recognition in the department.
